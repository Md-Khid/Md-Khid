            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>COVID-19 Country Grouping</strong></p>
            <p>This project employs a simple K-means clustering algorithm, along with tools like IBM SPSS Modeler and JMP 
              to evaluate COVID-19 risk levels across countries. It analyses factors such as demographics, GDP and disease 
              rates while managing multicollinearity to ensure the validity of the clustering outcomes. The simple K-means 
              method effectively groups nations by COVID-19 risk offering a benchmark for comparison. This facilitates a 
              mutual learning process allowing governments to learn from each other and adapt policies to their development 
              status and specific COVID-19 risks.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Data Piping and Wrangling: Patient Survey Experience</strong></p>
            <p>This project integrates Python, SQL, and R to streamline data preparation, focusing on data merging and 
              cleansing. It utilises surveys to assess patient satisfaction through a Linear Model. Data is transferred 
              from Excel to MySQL, forming precise database tables. SQL further refines these tables to ensure data consistency.
              R analyses this data, applying Linear Regression to predict satisfaction and identify influential variables. 
              Finally, a performance impact chart is created to highlight areas for improvement, suggesting ward adjustments to
              enhance patient satisfaction.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>MLR: Credit Card Billable Prediction</strong></p>
            <p>The project conducted an in-depth analysis of a credit facility dataset, uncovering insights into customer 
              demographics, credit behaviour and financial trends through diverse visualisation techniques. It then developed 
              a multi linear regression model to accurately predict billable amounts, showcasing its reliability in extrapolating to 
              new data. Demonstrating the value of data-driven insights, the project illustrates how such analytics can optimise 
              financial operations, improve service quality and drive informed decision-making in the banking sector. Through 
              predictive modelling, the project offered actionable insights, aiding in resource allocation, risk assessment and 
              strategic planning, thereby enhancing the efficiency and performance of credit facilities.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>ANN: Loan Status Prediction</strong></p>
            <p>The project involves analysing a credit facility dataset to predict the likelihood of customers defaulting on their 
              debt payments using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The dataset comprises various customer financial details,
              including demographics, loan grades and loan intents. Through Python coding, the project addresses data preprocessing,
              including handling missing values, special characters and encoding variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
              techniques are employed to understand data distributions, identify outliers and visualise correlations between 
              variables. The model is trained, evaluated and tested using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, 
              F1 score and AUC-ROC curve. Additionally, the importance of predictors in the model is determined to interpret its 
              decision-making process.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Civil Conflict And Food Aid</strong></p>
            <p>The project integrates data analysis and visualisation to explore the complex dynamics of governance, 
              food aid and conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Through data wrangling and visualisation techniques, 
              it highlights the correlation between governance indicators like Polity2 scores, economic factors such as GDP 
              and humanitarian assistance like emergency food aid. The analysis reveals how autocratic governance, limited 
              economic growth and uneven aid distribution exacerbate conflicts in the region. The analysis also emphasizes 
              the complexity of aid distribution and its impact on conflict escalation.</p>
