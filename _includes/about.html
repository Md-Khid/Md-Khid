                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Embarking on a new journey, I transitioned from being a compassionate healthcare professional (a graduate in Bachelor in Health Science - Nursing) to the dynamic realm of data analytics and coding. My nursing background, with its focus on patient care and pathways, laid the foundation for this evolution.<br><br><b>The Transition</b><br>As I navigated patient pathways and orchestrated care, I began to notice the inherent potential in administrative records and healthcare service data. Beyond the surface, these records held intricate patterns that hinted at ways to enhance patient outcomes and operational efficiency. This realization sparked a curiosity to explore the world of data analytics further.<br><br><b>The Inaugural Line of Code</b><br>Driven by this curiosity, I made the bold decision to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Business Analytics followed by a Master’s in Analytics and Visualization. Stepping away from the rhythm of patient heartbeats, I immersed myself in the binary hum of code. Each line of code and every data analysis brought me closer to unraveling a new hidden world that awaited discovery.</p>
