    <h1>COVID-19 Country Grouping</h1>
    <p>This project employs a simple K-means clustering algorithm, along with tools like IBM SPSS Modeler and JMP, to evaluate COVID-19 risk levels across countries. It analyzes factors such as demographics, GDP, and disease rates while managing multifunctionality to ensure the validity of the clustering outcomes. The simple K-means method effectively groups nations by COVID-19 risk, offering a benchmark for comparison. This facilitates mutual learning among governments, allowing them to adapt policies based on development status and specific COVID-19 risks.</p>
